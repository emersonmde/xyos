## Synopsis

XyOS is a very simple OS written in C.

I decided to start writing an OS kernel mostly just for fun and to learn how these low level functions work. I'd love to hear any advice or ideas on how I could improve it. I'm sure there's plenty of issues at the moment, but its a work in progress.
